# Railway vs Render Deployment Comparison

## Overview
This document compares Railway and Render deployments for the Field Elevate Hub application.

## Current Status
- **Render**: ✅ Working 100%
- **Railway**: ⚠️  Having issues (likely API key or configuration)

## Key Differences

### 1. Configuration Files
- **Render**: Uses `render.yaml` for declarative configuration
- **Railway**: Can use `railway.json` or `railway.toml` (optional) or configure via dashboard

### 2. Environment Variables

#### Render
- Automatically injects database URLs from linked services
- Uses environment groups for shared variables
- Example from render.yaml:
  ```yaml
  envVars:
    - key: DATABASE_URL
      fromDatabase:
        name: fieldelevate-db
        property: connectionString
    - fromGroup: field-elevate-shared
  ```

#### Railway
- Need to manually set environment variables via CLI or dashboard
- Commands:
  ```bash
  railway variables:set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
  railway variables:set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
  railway variables:set REDIS_URL=redis://...
  ```

### 3. Build Commands

Both platforms support similar build commands, but configuration differs:

#### Render (in render.yaml)
```yaml
buildCommand: npm install && cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
startCommand: node server.js
```

#### Railway (in railway.json or dashboard)
```json
{
  "build": {
    "buildCommand": "npm install && cd frontend && npm install && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

### 4. Database & Redis Setup

#### Render
- Automatically provisions PostgreSQL and Redis from render.yaml
- No manual setup required

#### Railway
- Need to add PostgreSQL and Redis plugins via dashboard
- Provides DATABASE_URL automatically when PostgreSQL is added
- Need to add Redis separately

### 5. Service Discovery

#### Render
- Services can reference each other using internal URLs
- Example: `https://fieldelevate-mcp-hub.onrender.com`

#### Railway
- Services communicate via Railway's private network
- Internal URLs format: `service-name.railway.internal`

## Troubleshooting Railway

### Step 1: Login to Railway
```bash
# Via browser
railway login

# Or with token
railway login --token YOUR_RAILWAY_TOKEN
```

### Step 2: Link to Project
```bash
railway link YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

### Step 3: Check Status
```bash
railway status
railway whoami
```

### Step 4: Set Missing Environment Variables
```bash
# Check current variables
railway variables

# Set missing ones
railway variables:set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
railway variables:set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables:set PORT=3000
```

### Step 5: Check Logs
```bash
# View recent logs
railway logs --tail 100

# Follow logs in real-time
railway logs --follow
```

### Step 6: Deploy
```bash
# Deploy current directory
railway up

# Or use the deployment script
node railway-agent.js
```

## Common Railway Issues & Solutions

### 1. Missing API Keys
**Error**: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not defined"
**Solution**: 
```bash
railway variables:set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### 2. Build Failures
**Error**: "Cannot find module" or "frontend/build not found"
**Solution**: Ensure build command includes all necessary steps:
```bash
npm install && cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
```

### 3. Database Connection Issues
**Error**: "Cannot connect to database"
**Solution**: 
- Add PostgreSQL plugin in Railway dashboard
- DATABASE_URL should be automatically set
- If not, manually set it

### 4. Port Issues
**Error**: "Port already in use" or app not accessible
**Solution**: 
- Railway assigns PORT automatically
- Don't hardcode ports, use: `process.env.PORT || 3000`

## Diagnostic Script

Run the diagnostic script to check your Railway setup:
```bash
node scripts/railway-diagnostic.js
```

This will:
1. Check Railway CLI installation
2. Verify login status
3. Check project connection
4. List environment variables
5. Show recent logs
6. Compare with Render configuration
7. Create railway.json template

## Pros & Cons Comparison

### Railway
**Pros:**
- Simple CLI deployment with `railway up`
- Good PostgreSQL/Redis integration
- Private networking between services
- Automatic SSL certificates
- Good developer experience

**Cons:**
- Need to manually set environment variables
- Less declarative than Render
- May need more initial setup

### Render
**Pros:**
- Declarative configuration with render.yaml
- Automatic environment variable injection
- Built-in health checks
- Easy multi-service deployment
- Environment groups for shared configs

**Cons:**
- More complex initial setup
- render.yaml can be verbose
- Service spin-down on free tier

## Recommendation

For your Field Elevate Hub with multiple microservices:
- **Render** might be better for production due to declarative config and automatic service linking
- **Railway** might be better for development/staging due to simpler deployment process

Once Railway is properly configured with all environment variables, both should work equally well.
