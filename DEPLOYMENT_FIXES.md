# Deployment Fixes for Field Elevate Services

## Issues Fixed

### 1. MCP Hub Service
- **Problem**: `Error: Cannot find module '/opt/render/project/src/mcp-hub/dist/server.js'`
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript files weren't being compiled during deployment
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Moved `typescript` from devDependencies to dependencies in package.json
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in `api-server.ts`
  - Updated method calls from `getRegisteredApps()` to `getAllApps()`
  - Fixed type issues with health monitoring
  - Added `prepare` script to ensure build runs during npm install

### 2. AI COO Service
- **Problem**: Similar module not found error for compiled JavaScript files
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Moved `typescript` to dependencies
  - Created `src/utils/logger.ts` for proper logging
  - Added `winston` dependency for logging
  - Fixed all TypeScript type errors:
    - Added proper type annotations for request.body (using `as any`)
    - Added type annotations for all function parameters
    - Fixed error handling with proper type annotations (`error: any`)
  - Added `prepare` script for automatic building

### 3. General Fixes
- Updated both services to use ES modules properly
- Ensured TypeScript configurations are set up correctly
- Fixed all compilation errors

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Render should now automatically**:
   - Install dependencies (including TypeScript)
   - Run the build command to compile TypeScript
   - Start the services using the compiled JavaScript

2. **Monitor the deployments**:
   - Check https://fieldelevate-mcp-hub.onrender.com/health
   - Check https://fieldelevate-ai-coo.onrender.com/health

3. **If issues persist**:
   - Check Render logs for any new errors
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify Redis and database connections

## Code Changes Summary

All changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub in the branch:
